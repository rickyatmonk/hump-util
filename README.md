## Overview
This project is a simple web app that uses https://github.com/domchristie/humps
to decamelize strings from a textarea input.

## Usage
This runs in your browser. The easiest way to get up and running is:

`npm install` to install the node modules.
`bower install` to install the client side dependencies.

`gulp serve` to launch the app and watch for changes.

`gulp` builds a `dist` directory that can be placed on a server.

## Structure
I used `yo gulp-webapp` to initialize this project.
I included the humps bower package.
I did nothing to remove unnecessary boilerplate.
